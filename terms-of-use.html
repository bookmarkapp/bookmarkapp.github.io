                                        be error-free or uninterrupted; that defects will be corrected; or that the

                                        jurisdiction, and the Bookmark Parties specifically disclaim such
                                        warranties.<br /><br />Some jurisdictions limit or do not allow the disclaimer
                                        of implied or other warranties, so the above disclaimer may not apply to you to

                                        authorities regarding your or any other party’s use of the Service; (f) any
                                        action taken in connection with copyright or other intellectual property owners;
                                        (g) any errors or omissions in the Service’s operation; or (h) any damage to any
                                        user’s computer, mobile device, or other equipment or technology, including,
                                        without limitation, damage from any security breach or from any viruses, bugs,
                                        tampering, fraud, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or
                                        transmission, computer line or network failure, or any other technical or other
                                        malfunction, including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
                                        goodwill, loss of data, work stoppage, accuracy of results, or computer failure
                                        or malfunction, even if foreseeable or even if Bookmark Parties have been
                                        advised of or should have known of the possibility of such damages, whether in
                                        an action of contract, negligence, strict liability, or tort (including, without
                                        limitation, whether caused in whole or in part by negligence, acts of God,
                                        telecommunications failure, or theft or destruction of the
                                        Service).<br /><br />In no event will Bookmark Parties be liable to you or
                                        anyone else for loss, damage, or injury, including, without limitation, death or
                                        personal injury. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
                                        incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may
                                        not apply to you. You agree that in the event you incur any damages, losses, or
                                        injuries that arise out of Bookmark’s acts or omissions, the damages, if any,
                                        caused to you are not irreparable or sufficient to entitle you to an injunction
                                        preventing any exploitation of any website, service, property, product, or other
                                        content owned or controlled by the Bookmark Parties, and you will have no rights
                                        to enjoin or restrain the development, production, distribution, advertising,
                                        exhibition, or exploitation of any website, property, product, service, or other
