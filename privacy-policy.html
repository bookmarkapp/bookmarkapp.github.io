                                        personal information you share with us. Our Privacy Policy highlights our
                                        procedures for account deletion and the handling of associated data. You have
                                        the option to delete your account whenever you wish, and all related personal
                                        information will be permanently eradicated from our systems, unless otherwise
                                        required by law. We prioritize the security of your data and employ robust
                                        measures to ensure its protection. To initiate the deletion process for your
                                        account, just click on the &quot;Delete Account&quot; button at the bottom of
                                        the Settings page from the Bookmark App. Once the deletion process begins, you
                                        won&#x27;t be able to reactivate your account or retrieve any of the content or
                                        information you have added. All the user data, right from login, prompts,
